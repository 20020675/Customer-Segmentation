# Customer-Segmentation
A shopping mall owner has gathered data of customers through membership cards. The customers are to be distributed in different groups considering their details like age, gender, income and spending score. This is to be done for extracting valuable insights and also for designing better marketing strategies. 

# Process
1)EDA:
Each feature is visualised with the help of bar graph. From this we can get to know the frequency of parameters that each feature contains.For eg. For gender we can find out the number of males and females. By visualisation correlation is made easy.

2)Determining the optimum value of k for k means clustering algorithm:
By elbow method we can know the optimum k value to be used.

3)Model Building
Implementing K means algorithm for segregating customers in different groups. 

# Visualisation of final output
The clustered data is visualised on a 3D plot.
